2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
    1. I have multiple images with alts describing them
    2. Each page has appropriate headings and paragraph text so that it is readable and easy to understand
    3. My footer has links to all my profiles, like linkedin, handshake, github, and my email.
    4. I have multiple pages with navigation between them in the header. Also I added if you click on my name in 
    the top left corner it brings you back to the home page. I always love that feature on other sites when I cant 
    find a go to home page button.
    5. I use many semantic tags, header, nav, main, section, and footer.
    6. I added font awesome and google fonts.
    (did more than 3 since i wanted the website to look a bit better) 

(b) CSS features
    1. I edited padding and margins to improve readability.
    2. I did a custom purple theme, I changed the colors of links, added a few hover capabilities and made all paragraph a specific color.
    3. I added bootstrap in to enhance my layout. I used some containers, row, column, and I used it for my profile images.
    4. Like I said above, google fonts and awesome fonts are both in there. I couldve only used one but I liked these two different fonts.

(c) Advanced features
    1. I have a permanent nag bar at the top to go from page to page, which makes a complex and persistent layout.
    2. I used nested selectors since I wanted cool hover effects for my links in my foot and my nav bar.
    3. I have a contact form using HTML with label areas to put all the information in.



3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
    EVERYTHING I IGNORED (only potential problems)- 
    1.4 Distinguishable - It was about changing my <i> to <em> but I needed those <i>s for font awesome to run properly. So I left them in. It would cause more probelms if i changed it because then the screen would see my icons as italics.
    It also does false postives for my imagine not being a good contrast, but my contrast is fine.
    1.1 Text Alternatives - All my photos have been reviewed and they all have alts and are described properly, so nothing needed to be changed.
    1.3 Adaptable - My page doesnt switch languages and all my content is listed correctly and not a list, so I ignored both of those.
    1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics - The only button that needed to be described was my contact form, which I did previously.
    2.4 Navigable - My links are grouped together already, I have a title and all my link text is meaningful.
    2.4.6 Headings & Labels - My headings are all correctly labeled.

    I did not have any known or likely problems, so the only ones are potentials. 
    The only potential error that I fixed was the skip list one. You can now skip to main, although it doesnt do much because my website isnt too long. 
    Potential seems to tell you every problem that could happen even if your code is perfect.



4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
    Total - 6 hours
    It took me about 3 hours to get my layout done, which was just my index.html. 
    Im very picky, so getting the colors and the fonts right took a while.
    The other 3 hours was on getting all my other pages done, and doing research to remind me how to do certain things in html/css.



5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
    * https://www.w3schools.com/  - used this for a reference to remember how to do everything
    * chatgbt - I used this to judge my layout. So id put in a screenshot and ask if theres anything else I should add.
    For example the little lines that are under my icons on the interests part of my home page was chatgbts idea. 
    I also used chatgbt to help me write all my paragraphs, so that they are written in perfect english with no grammar errors.
    *     - watched this youtube video before coding to remind myself what html and css look like. 
    Once I watched that it all came back to me and I was able to make my own prtfolio.

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
    I didnt consult anyone, the most I did was go and read peoples slack issues to see if I had them as well.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    No, theres nothing special going on. Just HTML with CSS, with bootstrap and fonts.
