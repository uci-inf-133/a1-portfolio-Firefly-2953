2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
    1. I have multiple images with alts describing them
    2. Each page has appropriate headings and paragraph text so that it is readable and easy to understand
    3. My footer has links to all my profiles, like linkedin, handshake, github, and my email.
    4. I have multiple pages with navigation between them in the header. Also I added if you click on my name in 
    the top left corner it brings you back to the home page. I always love that feature on other sites when I cant 
    find a go to home page button.
    5. I use many semantic tags, header, nav, main, section, and footer.
    6. I added font awesome and google fonts 



(b) CSS features



(c) Advanced features
